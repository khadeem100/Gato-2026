  about: Lucis is a European health-tech company redefining preventive medicine. By analyzing more than 180 biomarkers, Lucis combines AI and medical oversight to calculate a member's Biological Age and deliver a personalized roadmap across five pillars.
---

**The Challenge:** As Lucis expanded rapidly across Europe following their $8.5M seed round, they needed to formalize security practices without slowing down their engineering velocity.

**The Solution:** Probo's expert-led services adapted ISO 27001 to Lucis' actual architecture and workflows, running compliance in the background while the team stayed focused on growth.

**The Results:**

- ISO 27001 certified without compromising growth momentum
- Minimal internal workload for engineering team
- Continuous compliance monitoring as they scale across Europe

## About Lucis

[**Lucis**](https://www.lucis.life/) is a European health-tech company redefining preventive medicine. By analyzing more than **180 biomarkers**, Lucis combines AI and medical oversight to calculate a member's *Biological Age* and deliver a personalized roadmap across five pillars: nutrition, sleep, activity, supplements, and mental health.

Following a **$8.5M seed round,** Lucis is scaling rapidly across Europe. But with growth came responsibility: Lucis handles some sensitive data, personal health information. For the team, security wasn't a future concern. It was a prerequisite for trust.

## The Challenge: Scaling Fast Without Compromising Trust

As Lucis expanded across **France, the UK, Ireland, and Portugal**, **Baptiste Debever (co-founder and CTO)** and **Gauthier Wallet (Founding Engineer)** knew their informal security practices needed to become formal, without slowing the business down.

They faced three hard constraints:

- **Extreme data sensitivity**
    
    Unlike most B2C products, Lucis manages regulated health data. ISO 27001 wasn't a sales checkbox. It was a signal to users, partners, and regulators that security was foundational.
    
- **A lean, fast-moving team**
    
    With engineering focused on shipping product and improving member outcomes, the team couldn't afford months of manual documentation.
    
- **Compliance that reflected reality**
    
    Lucis didn't want a generic framework that looked good on paper. They wanted certification to reflect how they *actually* built and operated their systems.

**Baptiste Debever, CTO:**

> Security isn't just a technical requirement for us. From day one, it's been a core part of the trust relationship we have with our members.

## The Solution: ISO 27001 Without the Overhead

Lucis needed a way to turn their existing security mindset into a globally recognized certification, without pulling focus away from growth.

They chose [**Probo**](https://www.getprobo.com/) because it wasn't a rigid, checklist-driven approach. Probo adapted to Lucis' stack, processes, and pace, allowing the team to stay focused on product while certification progressed in parallel.

Probo delivered:

### 1. Compliance tailored to Lucis' reality

Instead of forcing Lucis into a generic model, Probo mapped ISO 27001 directly onto their actual architecture, workflows, and controls.

### 2. End-to-end execution

From gap analysis to audit preparation, Probo handled the documentation and coordination that typically stalls early-stage teams.

### 3. Asynchronous, low-friction collaboration

The entire process ran through Probo's platform and Slack, fitting seamlessly into Lucis' day-to-day operations.

**Gauthier Wallet, Founding Engineer:**

> Probo made the process feel effortless. They handled the heavy lifting in the background, and the asynchronous Slack-based collaboration fit perfectly with how we work.

## The Results: Certification Without Slowing Growth

With [Probo](https://www.getprobo.com/), Lucis achieved **ISO 27001 certification** while maintaining growth rate, proving that strong security can be built early, without slowing the business down.

**Baptiste Debever, CTO:**

> *From kickoff to audit, the entire certification process took far less time than we expected for ISO 27001.*

**Gauthier Wallet, Founding Engineer:**

> *The internal workload stayed extremely light. Probo absorbed the operational complexity, which let us stay focused on growth and our product.*

Today, ISO 27001 isn't a one-time milestone for Lucis, it's an ongoing standard. Probo continues to support ongoing compliance, monitoring improvements and ensuring Lucis stays aligned with best practices as the company scales across Europe.

## Why It Matters

Lucis didn't adopt ISO 27001 to satisfy a requirement. They did it to make security a default principle: early, intentionally, and without sacrificing momentum.

With [Probo](https://www.getprobo.com/), they proved that even at hyper-growth speed, startups can treat user data with the seriousness it deserves.
