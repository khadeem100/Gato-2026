description: Configure the Probo MCP Server with Zed editor
---

[Zed](https://zed.dev/) is a fast, collaborative code editor with native MCP support.

## Prerequisites

- Zed editor installed
- Probo API token (see [Authentication](/docs/api/mcp/authentication))
- Your Probo instance URL

## Configuration

### 1. Open Zed Settings

Open Zed settings by pressing `Cmd+,` (Mac) or `Ctrl+,` (Linux/Windows), or go to **Zed → Settings**.

### 2. Edit Configuration

Add the Probo MCP Server to your settings:

```json
{
  "context_servers": {
    "probo": {
      "settings": {
        "url": "https://your-probo-instance.com/api/mcp/v1",
        "headers": {
          "Authorization": "Bearer your_api_token_here"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Replace Placeholders

Update these values:
- `your-probo-instance.com` → Your Probo instance URL
- `your_api_token_here` → Your API token from Probo

### 4. Restart Zed

Restart Zed to load the configuration.

## Usage

Once configured, you can use Probo tools through Zed's AI assistant:

**Example queries:**
```
"List all high-priority risks in my organization"
"Add a new vendor called CloudBackup Inc"
"Show me all open nonconformities"
```

The assistant will automatically use the appropriate Probo MCP tools to fulfill your requests.

## Environment Variables

For security, use environment variables for your API token:

```json
{
  "context_servers": {
    "probo": {
      "settings": {
        "url": "https://your-probo-instance.com/api/mcp/v1",
        "headers": {
          "Authorization": "Bearer ${PROBO_API_TOKEN}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Set the environment variable before launching Zed:

```bash
export PROBO_API_TOKEN="your_api_token_here"
zed
```

## Multiple Environments

Configure different Probo instances for development and production:

```json
{
  "context_servers": {
    "probo-dev": {
      "settings": {
        "url": "http://localhost:8080/api/mcp/v1",
        "headers": {
          "Authorization": "Bearer ${PROBO_DEV_TOKEN}"
        }
      }
    },
    "probo-prod": {
      "settings": {
        "url": "https://probo.company.com/api/mcp/v1",
        "headers": {
          "Authorization": "Bearer ${PROBO_PROD_TOKEN}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Appearing

**Problem:** Probo tools aren't available in the AI assistant

**Solutions:**
1. Verify the configuration syntax is correct
2. Restart Zed completely
3. Check Zed logs for connection errors
4. Test the URL and token with curl:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     https://your-probo-instance.com/api/mcp/v1/health
   ```

### Authentication Errors

**Problem:** 401 Unauthorized errors

**Solutions:**
1. Regenerate your API token in Probo
2. Verify the token is correctly formatted as `Bearer your_token`
3. Check for extra spaces or newlines in the token
4. Ensure the token hasn't been revoked

### Connection Issues

**Problem:** Cannot connect to Probo server

**Solutions:**
1. Verify your Probo instance URL is correct
2. Check network connectivity
3. Ensure HTTPS is used for production instances
4. Verify firewall rules allow outbound connections

## Best Practices

- Use environment variables for API tokens
- Create separate tokens for each environment
- Rotate tokens every 90 days
- Use HTTPS for production connections
- Monitor token usage in Probo settings
