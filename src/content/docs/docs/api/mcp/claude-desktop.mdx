description: Configure the Probo MCP Server with Claude Desktop application
---

This guide shows you how to configure the Probo MCP Server with the Claude Desktop application, enabling Claude to interact with your compliance data directly from the desktop interface.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Desktop application installed (available for macOS and Windows)
- A running Probo instance with API access
- API token from your Probo instance

## Configuration Steps

### 1. Generate an API Token

First, generate an API token from your Probo instance:

1. Log into your Probo web interface
2. Navigate to Settings → API Tokens
3. Click "Generate New Token"
4. Copy the token - you'll need it for configuration

### 2. Locate Claude Desktop Configuration File

The Claude Desktop configuration file location depends on your operating system:

**macOS:**
```bash
~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

**Windows:**
```bash
%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

### 3. Configure the MCP Server

Edit the `claude_desktop_config.json` file and add the Probo MCP server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "probo-eu": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote@latest",
        "https://your-probo-instance.com/api/mcp/v1",
        "--transport",
        "http-only",
        "--header",
        "Authorization: Bearer your_api_token_here"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace:
- `https://your-probo-instance.com/api/mcp/v1` with your Probo instance URL (note the `/v1` suffix)
- `your_api_token_here` with the API token you generated

### 4. Restart Claude Desktop

After saving the configuration:

1. Quit Claude Desktop completely
2. Restart the application
3. The Probo MCP server will be loaded automatically

## Verify Connection

To verify the MCP server is working:

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Start a new conversation
3. Try asking: "List all organizations I have access to"
4. Claude should use the `listOrganizations` tool to fetch your data

You can also check the MCP server status by looking for the Probo server in Claude Desktop's status indicators.

## Example Interactions

Once configured, you can interact with your Probo data naturally:

### List Risks
```
You: "Show me all high-priority risks in my organization"

Claude: I'll fetch the risks for you.
[Uses listRisks tool]

Here are the high-priority risks:
1. Data breach from vendor systems
2. Inadequate access controls
...
```

### Add a Vendor
```
You: "Add a new vendor called 'CloudStore Inc' that provides storage services"

Claude: I'll add that vendor for you.
[Uses addVendor tool]

Successfully added CloudStore Inc as a vendor.
```

### Track Compliance Measures
```
You: "What compliance measures are currently in progress?"

Claude: Let me check the measures.
[Uses listMeasures tool with state filter]

You have 5 measures in progress:
- Employee security training
- Password policy enforcement
...
```

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Loading

If the Probo MCP server doesn't appear:

1. Check the configuration file syntax (must be valid JSON)
2. Verify the Probo URL is accessible from your machine
3. Ensure the API token is valid and not expired
4. Check Claude Desktop logs for errors

**View Claude Desktop Logs:**

**macOS:**
```bash
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log
```

**Windows:**
```bash
type %APPDATA%\Claude\logs\mcp*.log
```

### Authentication Errors

If you see authentication errors:

- Verify your API token is correct in the configuration file
- Check that the token hasn't expired
- Ensure the token is properly formatted in the `--header` argument
- Test the API token with curl:
  ```bash
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
    https://your-probo-instance.com/api/mcp/health
  ```

### Connection Timeouts

If requests timeout:

- Verify your Probo instance is running and accessible
- Check firewall settings
- Ensure your network allows connections to the Probo URL
- Try increasing timeout in the MCP configuration (if supported)

### Tool Not Found Errors

If Claude says tools aren't available:

- Restart Claude Desktop completely
- Verify the MCP server loaded without errors in the logs
- Check that your Probo instance supports the MCP API
- Ensure you're using a compatible version of Claude Desktop

## Security Best Practices

- **Store tokens securely**: Use environment variables or secure credential storage
- **Use HTTPS**: Always connect to Probo over HTTPS in production
- **Rotate tokens**: Regularly rotate API tokens
- **Audit access**: Review MCP access logs in your Probo instance
- **Limit scope**: Create tokens with minimal required permissions

## Next Steps
