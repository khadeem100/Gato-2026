The Probo MCP Server lets AI assistants interact with your compliance data. Use Claude, ChatGPT, or other AI tools to manage risks, vendors, and compliance activities through natural conversation.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard for connecting AI assistants to external data sources. The Probo MCP Server provides 32 tools for managing:

- Organizations, vendors, and people
- Risk assessments and mitigation
- Compliance measures and frameworks
- Assets and data classifications
- Nonconformities and obligations
- Continual improvements and audits

## Example Usage

```
"List all high-priority risks in my organization"
"Add a new vendor called 'Acme Corp' for cloud hosting"
"Show me all open nonconformities"
```

## Server Exploration

Use the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) to explore the Probo MCP Server interactively:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector https://your-probo-instance.com/api/mcp/v1
```

When prompted, provide your Bearer token for authentication. The inspector allows you to:
- Browse all available tools and their schemas
- Test tools with sample data
- View real-time request/response payloads
- Debug authentication and connection issues
