SOC 2 has become a must-have for many businesses. Whether or not you agree with
it, you’ll probably need it. But it doesn’t have to be painful or absurdly
expensive.

Here's what you actually need to budget for and where you can avoid unnecessary
spending.

## **What the SOC 2 process looks like**

1. Compare the SOC 2 framework to what you’re already doing.
2. Implement what’s missing—this could mean adding security measures (e.g.,
   2FA), policies (e.g., third-party management), or processes (e.g., access
   reviews).
3. Hire a third-party auditor to assess your compliance.

Sounds simple. But costs can stack up fast.

## **How much the audit costs**

The SOC 2 audit is your official proof of compliance. Costs depend on the scope:

- **Type 1 Audit** – A one-time snapshot of your security controls. Faster,
  cheaper.
- **Type 2 Audit** – Assesses your security over a period (3-12 months). Takes
  longer, costs more.

**Budget:** For a small business, $6,000–$7,000 is a reasonable budget.

## **The hidden cost of implementation**

Before the audit, you need to put policies, controls, and security measures in
place. That takes time, effort, and someone to own it.

Who’s doing the work?

- **Your team:** Expect at least 6 months of effort—often a full-time job.
- **A consultant:** That’ll run you $50,000+ (and you’ll still have to do a ton
  of work).
- **An automation platform:** Brings costs down to $10,000 but still requires
  oversight.

**Budget:** For small businesses, less than $3,000 should go toward content—the
real cost is in execution.

**Budget-friendly option:** Open-source tools like Probo or Comply (from
StrongDM) let you access knowledge for free and cut costs.

## **What’s worth paying for**

Not everything the compliance industry pushes is necessary.

### **Penetration testing**

SOC 2 doesn’t require penetration testing. For early-stage startups, it might
not even be useful—your product is still evolving, and security testing makes
more sense once it stabilizes.

If you do go for it, manual testing is worth it.

**Budget:** A proper penetration test starts at $5,000.

### **Security training**

Security training for employees is a good investment, but don’t overpay. Plenty
of **free resources exist**, and some vendors offer free tiers for startups.

**Budget:** $100/month is more than enough.

## **Keeping SOC 2 costs low every year**

Once you get your SOC 2 report, you’ll need to maintain compliance annually. But
that doesn’t mean bloated processes or expensive tools.

Example: Instead of a complex ticketing system for access management, a simple
Slack channel with timestamped approvals works just fine.

**Budget:** No need to scale expenses unnecessarily, stick to the same costs as
your first year.

## **The bottom line**

SOC 2 compliance doesn’t need to cost six figures. With a lean approach, small
businesses can stay compliant for around $10,000 per year, without wasting time
or money on unnecessary complexity, so they can focus on what truly matters:
building their business.
