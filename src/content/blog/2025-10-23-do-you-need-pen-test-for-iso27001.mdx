  - question: "If penetration testing is optional, how often should we do it?"
    answer: "If you choose to rely on a pen test as a risk control, industry best practice is to conduct one annually. It's also recommended to run a new test after major infrastructure or application changes."
  - question: "What's the difference between a vulnerability scan and a penetration test?"
    answer: "A vulnerability scan is automated and identifies known weaknesses using predefined signatures. A penetration test is a manual, adversarial simulation by experts attempting to exploit vulnerabilities, going beyond what a scan can detect."
  - question: "What happens if the pen test reveals critical vulnerabilities?"
    answer: "That's normal and expected. Your auditor will expect to see the pen test report, evidence of remediation plans, and status updates showing fixes or accepted risks. Addressing findings promptly is more important than having a clean report."

If you are on the path to ISO 27001 certification, you may be wondering: is a penetration test required? The short answer is no - penetration testing is not explicitly mandated by the ISO 27001 standard. 

However, it’s expected, especially for tech-driven organizations looking to demonstrate the effectiveness of their security controls.


### Key takeaways

- Penetration testing is expected, not mandatory: ISO 27001 does not require a penetration test. The framework is risk-based, allowing organizations to choose the controls that best suit their context.
- Alternatives are acceptable: You can use other methods—like vulnerability scanning, secure code reviews, or architectural assessments to address risk. But pen tests often provide the strongest proof of technical security maturity.


### Penetration testing in ISO 27001

ISO 27001 is not a checklist of technical tasks. It’s a risk-based information security framework that requires organizations to establish a formal **Information Security Management System (ISMS)**. 

The heart of an ISMS is the risk assessment: identifying, evaluating, and treating your organization’s unique information security risks. If your risk assessment identifies "technical vulnerabilities" - and it almost certainly will - then you must implement a risk treatment plan. 

A penetration test is one of the most effective and widely accepted controls you can use to meet this requirement. However, it’s not your only option. You can also address technical vulnerabilities using a layered approach:

- Automated vulnerability scanning for your systems and applications  
- Secure code reviews during software development  
- Security architecture reviews before launching new infrastructure  

The key is this: you must provide evidence that your vulnerability management processes are robust and effective. And for most companies, a penetration test offers the clearest and most compelling proof.


### Conclusion: Not mandatory, but expected

While penetration testing is not a strict requirement of ISO 27001, it is one of the strongest tools you can use to demonstrate risk management maturity. It should not be just just a checkbox - it is a valuable investment for your company.

### Frequently Asked Questions

1. **If penetration testing is optional, how often should we do it?**  

If you choose to rely on a pen test as a risk control, industry best practice is to conduct one annually. It’s also recommended to run a new test after major infrastructure or application changes.

2. **What’s the difference between a vulnerability scan and a penetration test?**  

- A vulnerability scan is automated and identifies known weaknesses using predefined signatures.  
- A penetration test is a manual, adversarial simulation by experts attempting to exploit vulnerabilities. It is going beyond what a scan can detect.

Both are valuable, but a pen test offers deeper insight and real-world validation of your defenses.


3. **What happens if the pen test reveals critical vulnerabilities?**  

That’s normal and expected. Your auditor will expect to see:
- The pen test report  
- Evidence of remediation plans  
- Status updates showing fixes or accepted risks

Addressing findings promptly and formally is more important than having a “clean” report.
