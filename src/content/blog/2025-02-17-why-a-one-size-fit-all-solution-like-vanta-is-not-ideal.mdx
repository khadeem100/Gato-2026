The compliance industry is obsessed with standardization. Big tech dumps
millions into compliance, while startups get shoved down the SOC2 (or ISO27001)
rabbit hole. Unable to grasp the complexity, most startups cave and play the
"check all boxes" game.

Dead wrong approach. Here's why.

## The false promise of universal solutions

Every startup hears the same pitch: "Use our platform, follow these steps,
you'll be compliant." Three fatal flaws with this:

1. It reduces compliance to a mindless checklist instead of what it is: a
   reflection of how your organization operates, manages risks, and protects
   value. A healthcare API handling patient data needs are different from a B2B
   analytics tool.
2. It sells false assurance. Having "standard" controls\* in place means nothing
   if they don't address your actual risks - whether they're security breaches,
   operational failures, or compliance violations.
3. It bleeds resources. Implementing irrelevant controls is like buying
   insurance for risks you don't have, while your actual vulnerabilities -
   across operations, security, and governance - stay exposed.

\*A control is a specific action, process, or technology put in place to reduce
business risks - whether they're security, operational, or compliance-related.

## Risk-first: the only way that makes sense

Stop following templates. Start with these questions:

- What needs protection? (data, operations, reputation)
- What could actually harm your business? (Not just breaches, but operational
  failures, compliance violations, loss of trust)
- Where are your current processes falling short?

This is where SOC2 and risk assessment frameworks become actually useful –
they're guides, not chains. They force you to think about real business risks:

### Customer trust:

- What happens if customer data leaks?
- How fast can you detect and respond to issues?
- What if your service goes down for a day?

### Operations:

- Who has access to what? Why?
- How do you prevent mistakes in production?
- What breaks when key people leave?
- How do you track and fix issues?

### Third-party:

- Which vendors can access your systems?
- What happens if they get breached?
- How do you monitor their performance?

### Regulatory & compliance:

- Which regulations apply to you?
- What happens if you miss a requirement?
- How do you track changes in compliance landscape?

Those risks are the foundation of everything: why implement GDPR if you have
nothing to do with the EU?

You might need fewer controls than the template suggests. Perfect.

Or you might need more in specific areas. Also perfect.

The point is: your controls should match your reality, not someone else's
checklist.

## Move Beyond the Checkbox

Founders: resist the easy path of one-size-fits-all solutions. It's a trap that
wastes time and creates false assurance.

Your compliance needs are as unique as your business model. Understand your
risks first. Build meaningful processes. Don't outsource your thinking to a
template.

Remember: compliance isn't about making auditors happy - you can push back: they
don’t know your company as well as you.

It's about proving to stakeholders that you run your business responsibly, not
just ticking boxes.
